# Electron Configuration Generator

This program takes the atomic number as input, and gives several outputs: Atomic Number, Period, Electron Configuration, and Valence Electrons.

The python file was built using python 3.5 and IDLE, nothing else.
The .exe was built using pyinstaller (found here: http://www.pyinstaller.org) and an icon from http://www.iconfinder.com

Not sure which one to use? The executable (.exe) will run on windows, and doesn't require python. However, if you have a different operating system or would like to run it with python (found here: http://python.org), you will need the python (.py) script.
