# periodic-test

This is my first python script, so it's ugly.

This program gives the period and electron configuration for a given atomic number. it has a built in exit function and will error out if an improper atomic number is given. it also has the beginning of being able to do an atomic charge as well, but is commented out at this time.

This was built with python 3.5 in IDLE, no external libraries required.
